# NetFlix-Dashboard-Visualization-with-Power-BI
Created a Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize various aspects of Netflix content using a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes details on Netflix shows, their ratings, availability across different regions, and classification into movies versus web series.
Preprocessed and cleaned the dataset using Excel and Power Query, ensuring data quality before visualization. Leveraging Power BIâ€™s interactive features, the dashboard provides insights into the regional distribution of content, compares the popularity and ratings of movies versus web series, and explores trends in viewer preferences. This project offers a comprehensive understanding of Netflix's content landscape through dynamic, data-driven visualizations.
